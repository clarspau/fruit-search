# Fruit Search
Welcome to the Autofill Draft exercise! In this project, you'll plan and build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit. Let's get started!

## Objective
Build an Autofill Search Bar that suggests fruits based on user input and allows users to select suggestions to populate the search bar.

## Instructions

## Step One: Planning
Before diving into coding, take some time to plan your approach:

° Consider the HTML structure for the search bar, dropdown, search button, and filler text.
° Plan the CSS styling for the color gradient on the page.
° Determine which JavaScript event listeners are needed to refresh the dropdown as the user types.
° Think about how to populate the search bar with a selected option from the dropdown.
° Consider the overall structure of your JavaScript functions.

## Step Two: Read the Starter Code
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the provided starter code. Ensure you understand its purpose and functionality before proceeding.

## Step Three: Create a Search Bar On Screen
Implement a search bar using HTML that accepts user input on the screen.

## Step Four: Add Placeholder Text Into The Search Bar
Set the search bar to display the placeholder text "Search fruit 🍎" when there's no user input.

## Step Five: Add An Event Listener For Key Strokes
Create a JavaScript event listener that triggers when a user types into the search bar.

## Step Six: Filter The List Based On User Input
Write a function search() to filter the fruit list based on user input. The function should return a list of matching fruits.

## Step Seven: Display The Results List As A Drop Down
Implement a dropdown list below the search bar to display the results generated by the search() function.

## Step Eight: Highlight the suggestion below a user’s cursor
Add an event listener to highlight a suggestion when a user hovers over it in the dropdown list.

## Step Nine: Populate the search box with a user’s selected suggestion
Implement functionality to populate the search bar with a user-selected suggestion when clicked.

## Step Ten: Style the Page
Apply CSS styling to the page to achieve a linear-gradient background and style the search bar.

## Completion
Once you've completed all the steps and tested your Autofill Search Bar, ensure it matches the provided mockup and functions as expected.

Happy coding! 🚀
